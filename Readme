 To Execute ./a.out <file name> .
 
 <file name> file should be existing in the same directory of the program . 
 
 output file is stored in a directory named "Assignment" as "output_<file name>" .
 this program uses lseek(),write(),stat(),open(),close(),read(),mkdir(),chdir(),access() system calls .

 problem_1.c :
 
 creates a directory named "Assignment" . move to the end of the input file using lseek() , start
 reading the input file using read() character by character by lseek() & stores them in temporary character
 and writes the content of temporary character into new file "output_<file name>" in the Assignment directory 
 using write() .it does this untill it encounters the beginning of the input file .

 problem_2.c:
 
 checks the existence of directory and output file using access() .
 shows all the permissions given to the directory and file using stat() .
 then checks for reversal of the input and output file as follows : 
 opens the input file and output file in the "Assignment" directory "output_<file name>"
 moves to the end of the output file using lseek() and starts reading both files using read() 
 comparing each characters of input file and output file return yes on a complete succesfull reversal 
 file otherwise no.
